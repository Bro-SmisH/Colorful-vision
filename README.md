Colorful Vision : A Creative exploration and Real time Image Coloration using deep learning  technique and OpenCV
- Description: This project aims to colorize black and white images using OpenCV and deep learning
techniques. The project will use a CNN model trained on a large dataset of color images to predict the
color channels of grayscale images and combine them to produce realistic colorized outputs.
- Technology: Python, OpenCV,
- Role: Computer Visions
